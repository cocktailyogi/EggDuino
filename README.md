This is the fork of cocktailyogi/EggDuino firmware with added support for servo lowering/raising speed and pin assignment for Protoneer CNC Shield.

Arduino Firmware for Eggbot / Spherebot with Inkscape-Integration

Version 1.6a
tested with Inkscape Portable 0.91, Eggbot Extension and patched eggbot.py

Regards: Eggduino-Firmware by Joachim Cerny, 2015

Thanks for the nice libs ACCELSTEPPER and SERIALCOMMAND, which made this project much easier. Thanks to the Eggbot-Team for such a funny and enjoyable concept! Thanks to my wife and my daughter for their patience. :-)

Features:

- Implemented Eggbot-Protocol-Version 2.1.0
- Turn-on homing: switch-on position of pen will be taken as reference point.
- No collision-detection!!
- Supported Servos: standard analog mini servos like TG9e, SG90, ES08MA, HXT900, etc.
- Full Arduino-Compatible. I used an Arduino Uno
- Button-support (3 buttons)

Tested and fully functional with Inkscape.

Installation:

- Upload Eggduino.ino with Arduino-IDE or similar tool to your Arudino (i.e. Uno)
- Disable Autoreset on Arduinoboard (there are several ways to do this... Which one does not matter...)
- Install Inkscape Tools wit Eggbot extension. Detailed instructions: (You yust need to complete Steps 1 and 2)

- Eggduino cannot be detected by default by the Eggbot-extension
    Hopefully, the guys will fix this later on. But we can fix it on our own.  
    Go to your Inkscape-Installation folder and navigate to subfolder .\App\Inkscape\share\extensions
        
For version 2.5.0:

    - open file "eggbot.py" in text editor and search for the line:
        "Try any devices which seem to have EBB boards attached"

    - comment that block with "#" like this:
        # Try any devices which seem to have EBB boards attached
        # for strComPort in eggbot_scan.findEiBotBoards():
        #   serialPort = self.testSerialPort( strComPort )
        #   if serialPort:
        #       self.svgSerialPort = strComPort
        #       return serialPort

    - In my version lines 1355-1360
    
For version 2.7.1:

    - open file "ebb_serial.py" in text editor and search for the following block:

        EBBport = None
        for port in comPortsList:
            if port[1].startswith("EiBotBoard"):
                EBBport = port[0]   #Success; EBB found by name match.
                break   #stop searching-- we are done.
        if EBBport is None:
            for port in comPortsList:
                if port[2].startswith("USB VID:PID=04D8:FD92"):
                    EBBport = port[0] #Success; EBB found by VID/PID match.
                    break   #stop searching-- we are done.      
 
    - replace "04D8:FD92" with the VID/PID of your Arduino device.  
    
    - alternatively, you can replace "EBBport = None" with your specific port number:
        EBBport = "COMxx"               #Windows
        EBBport = "/dev/tty[something]" #Linux/Mac
